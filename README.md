Melbourne Metro Train Timetable Site Arrivaltime.info

This code uses Angular JS + a restfull PHP API to bring back train Departure and Arrival times for the Melbourne Metro Train service.
The API hits the PTV API data. See the details on this API: http://stevage.github.io/PTV-API-doc/ You will need to register for access to the PTV API if you want to use the API.
